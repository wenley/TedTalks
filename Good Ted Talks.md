# Curated TED Talks
##### Maintained by Wenley Tong

**Disclaimer**: Even though I have been convinced by many of these talks, I do not (or no longer) agree with all of them,
and others I include because I believe they present strong arguments that must be addressed when discussing the relevant topic.
